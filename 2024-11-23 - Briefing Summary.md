**Irish General Election 2024: A Briefing Document**

This briefing document reviews the main themes and notable points from a selection of Irish political party manifestos and related sources ahead of the 2024 General Election. It focuses on Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Green Party, Labour, Aontú, and People Before Profit.

1. The Rise of Sinn Féin:

Sinn Féin positions itself as the party for "real change" after a century of rule by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Their manifesto, “Time to Change the Government”, emphasizes a clear choice for voters:

"On November 29th make your vote count. Vótáil Sinn Féin."

The party seeks to appeal to the "ordinary people" by promising to address issues like housing, healthcare, and childcare. Their Wikipedia entry highlights their historical significance in Irish politics, including their evolution from a revolutionary force to a democratic socialist party:

"Sinn Féin...is an Irish republican and democratic socialist political party active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland."

Sinn Féin's manifesto outlines specific commitments to workers and families, promising to strengthen worker rights, end the USC for middle-income earners, deliver the right to retire on a state pension at 65, increase the minimum wage, and initiate a large-scale housing construction program. They also highlight their commitment to environmental issues, pledging to meet climate targets fairly by targeting the carbon output of the wealthy, establish a nature restoration fund, and create a €2.5 billion renewable energy investment fund.


2. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael: The Established Parties:

Fianna Fáil, historically a dominant force in Irish politics, aims to secure its position through its detailed budgetary plans. Their manifesto highlights their proposed budgetary positions for 2025 and 2030, including a focus on national debt reduction and controlled spending growth. Fianna Fáil's Wikipedia entry reminds us of their historical dominance:

"Fianna Fáil was the most electorally successful party in 20th-century democratic Europe."

Fine Gael, currently leading the government, presents itself as the party with a plan to "secure your future," as stated in their manifesto:

"Fine Gael has the plan to secure your future."

Their leader, Taoiseach Simon Harris, emphasizes his connection with the people:

"Le seacht mí anuas, thaistil mé fud fad na tíre seo agus casadh na mílte daoibh orm. Phléamar na céadta saincheist agus d’éist mé libh."


3. Smaller Parties and Key Issues:

Smaller parties like the Green Party, Labour, Aontú, and People Before Profit aim to make their mark by addressing specific issues.

The Green Party emphasizes environmental policies, including a commitment to develop nighttime action plans and increase departmental funding for nightlife. They also propose a budgetary package focused on sustainability and environmental initiatives.
Labour prioritizes regional airport development and a commitment to the Irish language:
"Prioritise the sustainable development of regional airports…Gaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht - Teanga Bheo do gach saoránach in Éireann - An Ghaeilge sa Todhchaí."

Aontú emphasizes their commitment to representing the concerns of their constituents:
"Samhlaigh cad is féidir linn a dhéanamh le foireann de Theachtaí Dála Aontú ag troid i do chúinne agus ag seasamh go daingean ar cheisteanna atá tábhachtach duitse, do do ghnó agus do do theaghlach."

They also criticize the impact of EU laws on Irish farmers, particularly those related to "reclaimed bog.”

People Before Profit takes a strong stance on drug policy, advocating for the expansion of the Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme and a move towards decriminalization:
"Establish a State run distribution services with high levels of regulation and supervision including proper funding for needle exchange; Move towards a strategy of de-criminalisation of drugs.”

They also highlight the declining use of the Irish language and advocate for increased resources to support its revitalization.

4. Key Election Themes:

Several key themes emerge from these sources:

Economic Issues: All parties address economic issues, including housing affordability, cost of living, and employment. Sinn Féin focuses on its commitment to workers and families, while Fianna Fáil outlines detailed budgetary plans.
Environmental Concerns: Climate change and environmental policies are prominent, particularly in the manifestos of the Green Party and Sinn Féin.
The Irish Language: Revitalizing the Irish language is an important topic, with parties like Labour, People Before Profit, and the Green Party outlining specific policies to support its use and development.
A Change in Government: Sinn Féin's rise presents a challenge to the traditional dominance of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with voters potentially seeking change after years of familiar governance.
Conclusion:

The 2024 Irish General Election promises to be a significant turning point in Irish politics. Voters face a clear choice between the established parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and the rise of Sinn Féin, who are seeking to form a government for the first time. The smaller parties will play a crucial role in shaping the political landscape, particularly in potential coalition scenarios. The election will likely be determined by voters' responses to key themes like the economy, the environment, and the desire for change.
