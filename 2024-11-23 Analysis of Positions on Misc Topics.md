**Comparing Irish Party Positions on Startup Supports**

The sources provided do not offer a direct comparison of each party's specific stance on startup supports. However, they do contain information about their broader economic policies, which can provide some insights into their potential approaches to fostering entrepreneurship and supporting new businesses.

Here's a summary of relevant information found in the sources:

Aontú:
Emphasizes fiscal prudence and reducing national debt [1, 2]. This suggests a potentially cautious approach to government spending, which could impact the level of direct financial support for startups.
Champions rural interests and aims to revitalize rural communities [3, 4]. This focus could translate into policies supporting startups in rural areas, possibly through grants, tax incentives, or infrastructure development.
Advocates for economic justice and supporting families struggling with economic challenges [1, 2]. This social focus could lead to policies aimed at promoting social enterprises or startups addressing social issues.

Fianna Fáil:
Focuses on targeted measures for specific sectors, like hospitality and retail [5, 6]. It's unclear if this sector-specific approach would extend to dedicated support for startups in various industries.
Highlights their commitment to reducing healthcare costs [7, 8], which could indirectly benefit startups by lowering employee healthcare expenses.

Fine Gael:
Promotes a "pro-enterprise" approach and acknowledges the importance of SMEs [9, 10], suggesting a generally supportive environment for startups.
Faces criticism for prioritizing business interests over worker needs [10], which could raise concerns about the distribution of benefits from startup growth and potential worker exploitation.

Green Party:
Primarily focuses on environmental sustainability and related policies [11-13]. It's unclear how this focus would translate into specific support for environmentally-focused startups or if they would prioritize supporting startups in other sectors.

Labour Party:
Committed to strengthening workers' rights [14, 15]. This focus could lead to policies ensuring fair labor practices within startups, potentially influencing their growth and hiring practices.
Proposes a "well-regulated economy" [16], which could impact the ease of starting and operating a business, depending on the nature and extent of regulations.

People Before Profit:
Criticizes the current economic system and advocates for significant changes [17]. Their specific proposals regarding startup support remain unclear, making it difficult to assess their stance.

Sinn Féin:
Proposes a multi-pronged industrial strategy [18] without providing specific details. It's uncertain if this strategy would include targeted support for startups as drivers of economic growth and innovation.
Social Democrats:
Calls for a "dynamic private sector" while also advocating for increased taxes on businesses [19, 20]. This suggests a potential balancing act between encouraging entrepreneurship and ensuring fair contributions from businesses, including startups.
Overall, the sources provide limited direct information on each party's position on startup supports. While some parties express general support for businesses or specific sectors, their specific plans and potential trade-offs remain unclear. To get a comprehensive understanding, it's recommended to consult the parties' detailed policy documents and platforms.
